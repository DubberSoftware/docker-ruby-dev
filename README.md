# `alpinelab/ruby-dev` [![Docker Stars](https://img.shields.io/docker/stars/alpinelab/ruby-dev.svg?style=flat-square)](https://hub.docker.com/r/alpinelab/ruby-dev/) [![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/alpinelab/ruby-dev.svg?style=flat-square)](https://hub.docker.com/r/alpinelab/ruby-dev/)

This image provides an easy, generic, consistent and non-intrusive Docker Compose setup for all your Ruby projects.

The main goal of this project is to have a single Docker image to develop all your Ruby projects, with **all dependencies contained inside Docker** (like gems, NPM packages or even Ruby itself, that won't pollute your host environment) and without anything specific to the project in the Docker image (the **codebase is mounted directly from the host filesystem into the container**, thus you'll never have to build the image when you add a gem or change some code).

The Docker container also provides developer-friendly tools and behaviours like persisted **Ruby console history** (IRB and Pry), **shell history**, or even auto-installing dependencies (that's right:  simply change your `Gemfile` or `package.json` and **`bundle install` or `yarn install` will be run automatically** for you and only when necessary). It also provides a few CLI tools to get your hands dirty, but as least as possible: `vim`, `nano`, `heroku`.

The default command (when you just `docker-compose up`) is to run `foreman start`, thus starting whatever you put in your `Procfile`. All commands are run inside the container as the same user that owns your codebase (thus probably your host user), which means that any file generated inside the container (think of `rails generate`, `yarn init`, or even log files) will be owned by you (not by `root`, like they would with a default Docker configuration).

We try to use sane default conventions so you don't have to think about it, but this image also allows some configuration (_e.g._ Heroku CLI or Git authentication) and [customisation](#customisation) (install extra software inside the container). Head to [RECIPES.md](RECIPES.md) for more details and examples.

> **TL;DR** üôÑ
>
> * your codebase is 2-way-mounted from your host to `/app` inside the container
> * [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) is configured to store modules in `/app/node_modules`
> * [Bundler](https://bundler.io) is configured to store gems in `/bundle`
> * everything ran inside the container is done with your host user UID and GID
> * `bundle install` is run before any command, only if necessary
> * `yarn install` is run before any command, only if necessary
> * you can [customise](RECIPES.md) the image with extra software

## Usage

### Setup

Simply create a `docker-compose.yml` file in your project root directory like this:

```yaml
version: "3"
volumes:
  bundle:       { driver: local }
  node_modules: { driver: local }
  config:       { driver: local }
services:
  app:
    image: alpinelab/ruby-dev
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - bundle:/bundle
      - node_modules:/app/node_modules
      - config:/config
```

> :bulb: Feel free to use `alpinelab/ruby-dev:<ruby-version>`: we support multiple Ruby versions [via image tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/alpinelab/ruby-dev/tags/)

  <summary>If you're on MacOS, you'll very likely want to use Docker Sync too.</summary>

  > ‚ö†Ô∏è Use your **actual** application name suffixed with `-sync` instead of `your_app-sync` to prevent conflicts between your projects.

  0. install it with `gem install docker-sync`

  1. add a `docker-sync.yml` file:

      ```yaml
      version: "3"
      syncs:
        your_app-sync:
          src: ./
          sync_excludes: [log, tmp, .git, .bundle, .idea, node_modules]
      ```

  2. add the sync container as external container in `docker-compose.yml`:

      ```yaml
      volumes:
        your_app-sync: { external: true }
      ```

  3. use it by replacing `- ./:/app` with `- your_app-sync:/app:nocopy` in `docker-compose.yml`

  4. start the sync with `docker-sync start`

</details>

### Run

You can now start your project with:

```shell
docker-compose up
```

Or run any command (like `rake`, `bash`, or whatever else) with:

```shell
docker-compose run app [rake|bash|...]
```

> üí° Note that you don't need to prefix commands with `bundle exec`.

You can even bypass dependencies check before the command is run by overriding the entrypoint from the command-line:

```shell
docker-compose run --entrypoint=bypass app bash
```

## Customisation

You can customise this image by **building your own image based on this one** (or any of its tags, by appending them to the `FROM` step of the `Dockerfile`), and install additional software on top of it:

  1. create a `Dockerfile` in your project root folder, and add a build step that installs the APT package you need (other installation methods work too, but it's out of the scope of this documentation):

      ```Dockerfile
      FROM alpinelab/ruby-dev

      RUN apt-get update \
       && apt-get install --assume-yes --no-install-recommends --no-install-suggests \
            <INSERT APT PACKAGE NAME HERE> \
       && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
      ```

  2. change your `docker-compose.yml` to use this `Dockerfile` (rather than an upstream image) and to build it on-demand:
    * change this line:

        ```yaml
        image: alpinelab/ruby-dev
        ```

    * into this line:

        ```yaml
        build: .
        ```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è To **temporarily** install a package inside the container (_e.g._ for a one-time debugging session), you can simply run the following command from a shell inside the container:
>
> ```shell
> apt-get update && apt-get install <your_package>
> ```

## Known issues

A wild `node_modules` directory owned by `root` may appear in your codebase directory. This is due to Docker [creating the destination mount point](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/26051) for the bind mount. It should be solved when we will be able to reliably configure Yarn to [use an absolute directory](https://github.com/alpinelab/docker-ruby-dev/issues/1) (instead of relative `node_modules`) outside of the codebase, like we do with Bundler.
